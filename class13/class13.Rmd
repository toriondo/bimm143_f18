```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


work with structure 1HSG
```{r}
library(bio3d) 
file.name <- get.pdb("1hsg")
```
Read this into R and examine composition
```{r}
hiv <- read.pdb(file.name)
hiv
```
 Q1: What is the name of the two non protein resid values in this structure? 
 ~HOH and MK1
 What does resid correspond to and how would you get a listing of all reside values in this structure?

## Split into protein and ligand files

we will use the 'trim.pdb()' function to split our structure

```{r}
prot <- trim.pdb(hiv, "protein")
lig  <- trim.pdb(hiv, "ligand")

#now write these into their own pdb file
write.pdb(prot, file="1hsg_protein.pdb")
write.pdb(lig, file="1hsg_ligand.pdb")
```
